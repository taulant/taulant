## Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Taulant but most people call me Tau
I have 10 years experience coding and designing artifacts for the web. I've seen the web evolve and the tools change. I've been on the designing side and I've been on the building side of things. My experience gives me a unique perspective on making software that looks and works well.
