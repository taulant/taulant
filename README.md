## Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Taulant but most people call me Tau
I currently work as a Software Developer at Avaya on the Spaces team. I am currently working mostly with React.

## What is Avaya Spaces?
Spaces is an app that centralizes your team conversations into one place. It supports all of todayâ€™s most preferred forms of communication like phone, email and chat.

## I ðŸ’š programming
I am a self taught programmer. Even though most of my career I've worked as a Designer, I've always had a passion for programming and looked for ways to integrate my programming knowledge when I was designing digital products. 

## Mentoring
If you are a designer who is trying to switch careers to programming I am happy to give you some pointers and tips on how to interview and position yourself.
